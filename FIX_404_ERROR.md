# üî¥ FIXING THE 404 ERROR - STEP BY STEP

## The Problem
You're getting a 404 error because Vercel hasn't been configured with your API key yet.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION - Follow These Exact Steps:

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Open: https://vercel.com/login
2. Sign in with your GitHub account

### Step 2: Import Your Project (if not already done)
1. Click "Add New..." button (top right)
2. Select "Project"
3. Find and click on `samarpithmenezes32/news-api`
4. Click "Import"

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variable (CRITICAL!)
**Before clicking Deploy**, you MUST add the environment variable:

1. Look for "Environment Variables" section
2. Click to expand it
3. Add:
   - **Name**: `NEWS_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `ce0f35c908664e329facbce4e5a0b973`
   - **Environment**: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Click "Add" button

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Now click "Deploy" button
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 5: If Already Deployed Without API Key
If you already deployed and are seeing the 404:

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Click "Environment Variables" in left sidebar
4. Click "Add New" button
5. Add:
   - **Key**: `NEWS_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `ce0f35c908664e329facbce4e5a0b973`
   - Check all environments
6. Click "Save"
7. Go to "Deployments" tab
8. Click "Redeploy" button on the latest deployment
9. Select "Redeploy with existing Build Cache"
10. Click "Redeploy"

## üéØ Why This Happens:

- ‚ùå `.env` files don't get deployed to Vercel (they're gitignored for security)
- ‚ùå `.env.example` is just a template, not used by the app
- ‚úÖ Vercel needs the API key added in its **dashboard** as an environment variable

## After Following These Steps:

Your site will show:
- ‚úÖ Real news articles
- ‚úÖ Working category filters
- ‚úÖ No more 404 error!

---

## Quick Verification:
After redeploying, open your Vercel URL and check:
- If you see "Error loading news. Please check your API configuration" ‚Üí API key not added correctly
- If you see "Loading news..." forever ‚Üí API endpoint issue
- If you see actual news articles ‚Üí ‚úÖ SUCCESS!
